<p>Shroom Kingdom is a building and jump'n'run game inspired by Super Mario where anyone can earn tokens by participating
in the game.</p>
<p>All assets that will be used in Shroom Kingdom are user provided.
To be able to play the game the user must either own a hackable Nintendo Switch and the game Super Mario Maker 2
or it is alternatively possible to use game modifications with assets that are user created.</p>
<p>The main activities in the game are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="3_Game_Activities/1_Building_Levels.html">Building new levels</a></li>
<li><a href="3_Game_Activities/2_Playing_Levels.html">Playing existing levels</a></li>
<li><a href="3_Game_Activities/3_Challenges.html">Participating in challenges to win leaderboard prices</a></li>
<li><a href="3_Game_Activities/4_Super_Virtual_World.html">Super Virtual Worlds</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Players can earn tokens by participating in these game activities.
The native token that will be used for all activities is called Shroom (SHRM).
Since SHRM tokens will be provided for playing the game, there won't be an upper limit.
The exact token economics are explained in <a href="4_Token_Economics.html">its chapter</a>.</p>

to his account.</p>
<p>To make the onboarding process of new players from Web2 as easy as possible,
there will alternatively be an option to create an account via Discord OAuth2 login.
A wallet will be generated for the user, which will be managed by the application.
The application will keep track of how many SHRM tokens the user posseses.
The user can always decide to claim his account by creating a key pair and asking the application
to transfer ownership.</p>
<p>The onboarding process of new players is free as there is no investment required to play the game.
Players can start earning SHRM tokens by playing levels.
Once they earned enough tokens, they can go to a DEX and exchange SHRM tokens for NEAR tokens to pay gas fees.</p>
<p>This onboarding process fits to the general consensus of NEAR Protocol as being one of the blockchain
technologies with astounding UX.</p>

<p>Levels can be built off-chain, while still in development.</p>
<p>All APIs will be served from Cloudflare Workers.</p>

SVWs can be purchased on our (upcoming) NFT marketplace in exchange for NEAR tokens.</p>
<p>SVWs are 2-dimensional top-down maps, that can be edited by its owner.
You can place your NFT levels and connect them via paths to let other players
have a more challenging and more fun way to play through your list of levels,
thus it is an easy way to advertise them.</p>
<p>To make SVWs even more compelling there will also be a variety of NFTs that can be additionally
placed on the map and players can interact with them to get temporary upgrades or boosts.
These special NFTs can be minted by all players after achieving several milestones or
you can get them as a reward from <a href="3_Game_Activities/3_Challenges.html">challenges</a>.</p>

<p>The native Fungible Token for Shroom Kingdom is called Shroom and has the symbol SHRM.
Fungible Tokens do not differ from each other and are a common way to develop &quot;money-like&quot; tokens.</p>
<p>Since SHRM is commonly minted by playing on Shroom Kingdom, there is no upper limit.
Instead, a constant minting and burning mechanism should make sure, that the token's value
won't suffer from inflation or deflation.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind, that this document often talks about minting, but in fact the tokens
do not yet exist on-chain.
Instead they will be stored in an off-chain database first.
The user can then decide to mint its SHRM tokens by calling a Smart Contract.
This mechanism is explained more in depth in the <a href="6_Token_Economics.html#smart-contract-details">Smart Contract details</a></p>
<h2 id="minting-and-burning"><a class="header" href="#minting-and-burning">Minting and burning</a></h2>
<p>SHRM tokens will be minted by one of the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>finishing a level (max 5 x 1 SHRM / day)</li>
<li>voting/rating a level (max 1 x 3 SHRM / day)</li>
<li>daily challenges (5 SHRM / day)</li>
<li>passive generation while others play own levels (max 8 SHRM / day).</li>
</ul>
<p>SHRM tokens will be burned by one of the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>unlocking new building blocks and entities that can be placed in levels (token amount varies)</li>
<li>minting of levels (100 SHRM)</li>
<li>challenge passes (tbd)</li>
<li>virtual land acquisition and NFTs involved (tbd)</li>
</ul>
<p>Since Shroom Kingdom will launch with relatively few game mechanics as a Minimum Viable Product,
there won't be many ways for burning SHRM tokens.
Once more game mechanics will be implemented, there will also be more ways to burn tokens.
To prevent inflation in the early days after launch, a multiplier will be applied to all previously
mentioned minting mechanisms.</p>
<p>To make sure that every kind of player enjoys playing on Shroom Kingdom, the SHRM token minting
will be capped at 13 SHRM per day (8 SHRM for playing/building + 5 SHRM for daily).
Players can either decide whether they want to earn their tokens by playing or building levels
or by a combination of both.</p>
<h2 id="initial-shrm-token-launch--funding"><a class="header" href="#initial-shrm-token-launch--funding">Initial SHRM token launch &amp; funding</a></h2>
<p>Shroom Kingdom will be community funded.
No Venture Capital is involved.

<p>The IDO will be launched in three phases with increasing token amount,
because more people will become interested over time about Shroom Kingdom.
The exact token amounts are:</p>
<ul>
<li>750,000 SHRM (date will be announced)</li>
<li>1,000,000 SHRM (two months later)</li>
<li>1,250,000 SHRM (two months later)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="smart-contract-details"><a class="header" href="#smart-contract-details">Smart Contract details</a></h2>
<p>The SHRM token Smart Contract needs to be able to mint tokens on demand.
Since tokens are tracked in an off-chain database before minting,
the backend would need to read this information.
Only the backend is allowed to directly read and write values to the database.</p>
<p>To be able to mint new SHRM tokens, the backend would have to read the pending
SHRM token rewards from the off-chain database.
Then it would call the Smart Contract to mint tokens and update the value in the database respectively.
This approach has the drawback, that it could potentially be exploited,
since the backend API would have to pay the gas fees for minting SHRM tokens.</p>
<p>To avoid this problem, a different approach is used where the pending SHRM token rewards will be tracked
in the Smart Contract itself, which will be updated once per day.
The user has then the ability to mint tokens himself by calling the Smart Contract.
As a result the user would have to pay the gas fee for minting and the backend would
only have to pay the gas fee once per day for updating the pending rewards in the Smart Contract.
The only disadvantage of this approach is that pending rewards will be locked for at most 24 hours.</p>

<p>This chapter discusses several USPs, that make Shroom Kingdom unique and valuable.</p>
<h2 id="near-protocol"><a class="header" href="#near-protocol">NEAR Protocol</a></h2>
<p>Shroom Kingdom will be developed on NEAR Protocol, which is a Smart Contract capable layer-one blockchain.</p>
<p>NEAR Protocol wants to solve scaling issues of prior blockchains by introducing a sharded architecture.
With a block time of about 1 second and very low gas fees, transactions are both fast and cheap.
The sharding architecture makes sure, that these metrics won't change with an increasing amount of transactions.
NEAR Protocol is also

<line x1="10" y1="14" x2="21" y2="3"></line>
</svg></a> by supporting green projects.
Another aspect about NEAR Protocol is its focus on User Experience,
which includes the smooth user onboarding process but also for developers the ease of use of building Web3 applications.</p>
<h2 id="technology-stack"><a class="header" href="#technology-stack">Technology stack</a></h2>
<p>The game itself will be a web application.
It runs in browsers via Rust compiled to WebAssembly and uses WebGL2 for rendering.</p>
<p>WebAssembly is a new binary format for the web, that has been available in all major browsers since 2018.
Ever since then it found its way into other environments like &quot;regular&quot; backends, serverless and blockchain.
The reason behind this is its built in portability and security.
WebAssembly is meant to be a common compilation target for many programming languages,
which makes it possible to allow cross language communication via

<line x1="10" y1="14" x2="21" y2="3"></line>

<p>NEAR Protocol also allows building Smart Contracts that compile to WebAssembly.
This approach of building Smart Contracts has the extreme advantage over other Smart Contract capable blockchains,
that developers have a choice of what programming language they want to use.
NEAR Protocol already allows building Smart Contracts with their

Both these languages pioneer the WebAssembly format and are considered the best choice,
if you want to compile to WebAssembly.</p>
<p>The app will also be built as a Progressive Web App (PWA).
PWAs let you install web applications to your home screen and allow client side caching.
Depending on the platform, the process for this is slightly different and eventually
only specific browsers will be able to do so.
PWAs launch in full screen and will automatically be updated on a cache miss with the new version of the application.
The distribution of PWAs doesn't happen from centralized app stores, which fits into the idea of blockchain.</p>

which is a serverless edge computing environment.
Edge computing is a terminology focused on bringing computing as close to the source of data as possible in
order to reduce latency and bandwidth use.
Serverless is a way of running stateless functions on a cloud server.
It is another abstraction layer above cloud computing and uses a pay-per-use model rather than having running server costs.
You also don't have to care about scaling your backend,
because serverless functions automatically scale with the amount of requests.
Other resources that the serverless functions depend on
can still become a bottleneck in the overall architecture of the application, e.g. the database.</p>

<p>This chapter will talk about the way the community is incentivised to participate and how this system of a
Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) works.</p>
<h2 id="what-a-dao-is"><a class="header" href="#what-a-dao-is">What a DAO is</a></h2>
<p>A DAO is a form of government that is responsible for the blockchain.
It has to follow rules that are transparent to everyone and as many decisions as
possible will be decided following these pre-defined rules.
This will happen either automatically (through contracts), by the whole community or by a council.
How to become a member and who is a member should be transparent to the community and in theory these people
are supposed to make decisions that represent the community in a pre-determined form,
rather than making decisions for their own good.
The community then can make proposals that are then voted for or against within these guidelines.</p>
