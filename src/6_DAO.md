# Decentralized Autonomous Organization

This chapter will talk about the way the community is incentivised to participate and how this system of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) works.

# What a DAO is

A DAO is a form of government that is responsible for the blockchain. It has to follow rules that are transparent to everyone and as many decisions as possible will be decided following these pre-defined rules. This will happen either automatically (through contracts), by the whole community or by a council. How to become a member and who is a member should be transparent to the community and in theory these people are supposed to make decisions that represent the community in a pre-determined form, rather than making decisions for their own good.
The community then can make proposals that are then voted for or against within these guidelines.

# The Shroom Kingdom DAO

For Shroom Kingdom <a href="//https://www.sputnik.fund/#/dao/shrm.sputnikdao.near" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SputnikDAO{{#include icons/link.svg}}</a> will be used. This is a DAO of DAOs that has tools to make the process of proposals and votes possible for small DAOs. Shroom Kingdom DAO will have a council, and this council at the moment is only the founder (Tarnadas). More members will be added as the project grows and matures. 

The members of the DAO or temporary supporters of the project will be able to receive payouts via Sputnik DAO that will be approved by the council or specific members of it.  

You can participate in the DAO through joining the Discord and applying as a DAO-member or to do certain tasks that are necessary to be paid out in SHRM and be part of the community.

# Workload And Payouts

The payout will be in SHRM and depending on the task and position. In general, to receive payouts you need a <a href="//near.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NEAR{{#include icons/link.svg}}</a>-wallet and there is no pre-defined workload. In general you should be motivated to actively look for tasks and interact with the community or other DAO-members. Be part of the project, be passioned and try to enroll in positions and tasks that are likely to be fun and enjoyable for you.
