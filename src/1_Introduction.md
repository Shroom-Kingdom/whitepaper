Shroom Kingdom is a building and jump'n'run game inspired by Super Mario where anyone can earn tokens by participating
in the game.

All assets that will be used in Shroom Kingdom are user provided.
To be able to play the game the user must either own a hackable Nintendo Switch and the game Super Mario Maker 2
or it is alternatively possible to use game modifications with assets that are user created.

The main activities in the game are:

- [Building new levels](3_Game_Activities/1_Building_Levels.md)
- [Playing existing levels](3_Game_Activities/2_Playing_Levels.md)
- [Participating in challenges to win leaderboard prices](3_Game_Activities/3_Challenges.md)
- [Super Virtual Worlds](3_Game_Activities/4_Super_Virtual_World.md)

Players can earn tokens by participating in these game activities.
The native token that will be used for all activities is called Shroom (SHRM).
Since SHRM tokens will be provided for playing the game, there won't be an upper limit.
The exact token economics are explained in [its chapter](4_Token_Economics.md).
